        <p>
            I'm a software developer, hobbyist and petrolhead. I like stuff like technical architecture and software design, manual gearboxes and simulators. I'm also the father of two clever little boys and the husband of a goddess.

            I've been a professional software engineer since 2003 when I took my first job at a small company in Stellenbosch, working on shipping management systems. Since then I've been involved in 3 or 6 different companies (depending on how you consider mergers and aquisitions) around the fin-tech space.
